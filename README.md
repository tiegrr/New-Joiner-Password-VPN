# New-Joiner-Password-VPN
Very simple script to setup New Joiners with a "default" password and also add them to a VPN security group that allows them to use MFA to login to the company's VPN.  

The "default" password expires immediately and requires them to change their password on the first login.

Script will also ask for any DLs or security groups you want to add the new joiner to
